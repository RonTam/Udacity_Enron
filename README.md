### Introduction
Once a darling of Wall Street, Enron is better known today as a symbol of corporate fraud and corruption.  The scandal highlighted the dangers of creative accounting practices and pointed a spotlight at regulators to find ways to avoid future catastrophies from corporate misdeeds.

As a consequence of the investigations into Enron, federal regulators released mountains of information (typically confidential) regarding the activities of company executives prior the firm's dissolution.  In this project, we will study a subset of these documents, to see whether we can identify a "person of interest" based on data gathered on a number of company executives.  We will build a number of machine learning models to predict whether an individual is considered a person of interest, and analyze the accuracy of our results.
